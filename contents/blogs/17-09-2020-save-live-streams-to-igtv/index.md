Instagram had recently changed the APIs which prevented Streamon from saving your live streams to Stories. Since the latest update of Instagram app users can save their live stream sessions to IGTV within 30 days from the live archive. Here are the steps on how you can save the streams done using Streamon to be saved into your IGTV directly from the Instagram App.

## 1. Create a live stream
Make sure you have done a live stream using [Streamon](https://getstreamon.com) or Instagram app in the last 30 days. If you are new to Streamon you can checkout the tutorials and blogs in our website to learn more about how to professionally stream to Instagram live from your desktop.

## 2. Checkout your live archive
Goto your profile page in Instagram, click on the menu icon on the top-right corner and go to Archive and choose Live Archive from the top drop down.

## 2. Choose an live archive and share it to IGTV
Once you are in your Live Archive screen, you will see all of your live streams from past 30 days. You can click on any one of them and click on the share icon at the bottom to start sharing your Live Stream to IGTV.

> This feature is still rolling out to instagram users, if you don't see any streams or any option, it's likely you haven't received the update yet

## 3. Choose a cover image
After clicking on share, Instagram will ask you to choose a cover image for your IGTV post, you can choose a screenshot from the video/stream or manually choose an image from your gallery.
